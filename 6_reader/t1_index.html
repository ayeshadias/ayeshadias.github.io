    <h1>Reversing the Flow of Internet Expansion</h1>

    <h3>Why would you want to contract when you can expand?</h3>

    <p class="para1">Internet activity is supposed to be a positive act of self-expansion. We fill up the internet with our lives. It is a conquest that seeks more users, more followers, more hits, increases in speed, increases in storage space, and the acquisition of new and better methods to manage and sustain an ever-expanding quantity of data. Keeping pace with this growth has become required participation for a normal person living according to the customs of our time. A sort of millennial manifest destiny, the growth of the internet is widely considered good evolution for humanity. But if the internet is expanding, something else must be contracting because of that expansion.
