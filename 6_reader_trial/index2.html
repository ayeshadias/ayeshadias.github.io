      <p>For those of us who spend a lot of time on the internet, there will be the occasional urge to simply disappear - delete your accounts, roll back your Google results and become invisible. A lot of people seem to be interested in making that a reality - or at least in trying to completely cover up their tracks.</p>

      <p>Signal, a text and phone-call encryption app that comes with a recommendation from Edward Snowden, recorded a 400 per cent jump in downloads after the US election. And while landlords, colleges and potential employers have examined the social-media presence of applicants for years, there are signs that this kind of scrutiny is close to getting much more invasive.</p>

      <p>A person's digital trail can also serve as the primary gateway to information used nefariously, opposition-research-style, in the online harassment of private individuals.</p>

      <p>But what does "disappearing" online mean, anyway? Deleting all your social-media accounts or simply cleaning them up? Is it possible to totally disappear? Should you? Is there some real benefit to having an online presence? And what do you do if you still need to be on the internet, just not quite as much as you currently are?</p>
